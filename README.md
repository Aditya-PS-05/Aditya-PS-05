Hi, I’m [Aditya](https://adityaps.work).

Working at [HAQQ Studios](https://github.com/HAQQ-Studios).

I’m building scalable apps and developer tools across Web2, Web3, and AI, exploring Rust, Blockchain, and Golang microservices.

I’m currently a student at NIT Trichy and have previously worked on projects ranging from AI-powered applications to high-performance backend systems with AWS, Golang, and React Native. 

The best way to track my work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aditya-PS-05).
