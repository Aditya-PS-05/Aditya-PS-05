Hi, I’m [Aditya](https://adityaps.work).

I’m building scalable apps and developer tools across Web2, Web3, and AI, exploring Rust, Blockchain, and Golang microservices.

My goal is to make technology more accessible and impactful by creating faster, reliable, and innovative products.

I’m currently a student at NIT Trichy and have previously worked on projects ranging from AI-powered applications to high-performance backend systems with AWS, Golang, and React Native.

The best way to track my work is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Aditya-PS-05).
